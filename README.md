## How to test

### Backend

Tests are written using `jest` and `supertest`.

To run backend tests:

```bash
npm test
```

Tests cover:

- Prompt validation
- Response matching
- Error handling for invalid/missing inputs

---

## Optimization

- Refactored backend to separate routing (`chat.routes.js`) from business logic (`chat.service.js`)
- Used a clean module-based architecture for chat functionality
- Implemented auto-scroll on new messages for a better UX
- Simulated bot response by adding typing indicators and small delay
- Button toggles recommended questions for better user interaction

---

## Future Work

- Add persistent chat history (localStorage or database)
- Implement authentication with Google login option and user profiles
- Support richer content in messages
- Write unit and integration tests for the Angular app
